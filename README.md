# JTSidePanels
Reveal side view controllers with pure Swift 2.0 code. JTSidePanels is a UIViewController container designed for presenting a center panel with revealable side panels - one to the left and one to the right. This is a Swift 2.0 port of the amazing JASidePanels project found at https://github.com/gotosleep/JASidePanels/.

Usage
---

The only file required to use JTSidePanels: ` JTSidePanelController.swift `

The easiest way to use JTSidePanels is to copy the files into your Xcode project.

Alternatively, you can setup a git submodule and reference the files in your Xcode project. I prefer this method as it enables you to receive bug fixes/updates for the project.
` git submodule add https://github.com/itsProf/JTSidePanels.git JTSidePanels `
